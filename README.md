# Business Data Modeling Case Study (Group Project)

**Research Questions:** Construct a model that can predict the average life expectancy of a country. To build this model, we are trying to answer the overarching question: 

    *“What predictors significantly affect life expectancy?”* 

To answer this question, we must determine which predictors are insignificant to the model and if these can be removed. Afterwards, we will try to answer questions such as:

    1) Which factors influence life expectancy the most?
    2) Which region has the greatest effect on increasing life expectancy?
